# THIS IS A PROTOTYPE

This is a prototype developed in 2014.

Even knowing that it is not 100% functional, it is in here just for 
collaborative purposes.

This library is intended to be used to extract the data collected by the 
Fast Data Logger (FDL) for the Low Level Radio Frequency sytem (LLRF), and 
act as an interface with any other plotting tool.

The test/data/files are not included in this repository on purpose, because 
they are quite heavy and in fact, if you don't have any of those files, 
maybe you don't need this library in the first place :wink:
